   *  Repeats the source observable sequence the specified number of times or until it successfully terminates. If the retry count is not specified, it retries indefinitely.

   *
   * @example
   *  var res = retried = retry.repeat();
   *  var res = retried = retry.repeat(2);
   * @param {Number} [retryCount]  Number of times to retry the sequence. If not provided, retry the sequence indefinitely.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence producing the elements of the given sequence repeatedly until it terminates successfully.
