  /**
   * Returns two observables which partition the observations of the source by the given function.
   * The first will trigger observations for those values for which the predicate returns true.
   * The second will trigger observations for those values where the predicate returns false.
   * The predicate is executed once for each subscribed observer.
   * Both also propagate all error observations arising from the source and each completes
   * when the source completes.
   * @param {Function} predicate
   *    The function to determine which output Observable will trigger a particular observation.
   * @returns {Array}
   *    An array of observables. The first triggers when the predicate returns true,
   *    and the second triggers when the predicate returns false.
