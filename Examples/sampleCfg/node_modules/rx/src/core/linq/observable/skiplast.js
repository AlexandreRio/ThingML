  /**
   *  Bypasses a specified number of elements at the end of an observable sequence.
   * @description
   *  This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store the first `count` elements. As more elements are
   *  received, elements are taken from the front of the queue and produced on the result sequence. This causes elements to be delayed.
   * @param count Number of elements to bypass at the end of the source sequence.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence containing the source sequence elements except for the bypassed ones at the end.
