   * Returns a new observable that triggers on the second and subsequent triggerings of the input observable.

   * The argument passed to the N-1th triggering is held in hidden internal state until the Nth triggering occurs.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable that triggers on successive pairs of observations from the input observable as an array.
