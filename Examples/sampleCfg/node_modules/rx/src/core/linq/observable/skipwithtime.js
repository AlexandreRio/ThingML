  /**
   *  Skips elements for the specified duration from the start of the observable source sequence, using the specified scheduler to run timers.
   *
   * @example
   *  1 - res = source.skipWithTime(5000, [optional scheduler]);
   *
   * @description
   *  Specifying a zero value for duration doesn't guarantee no elements will be dropped from the start of the source sequence.
   *  This is a side-effect of the asynchrony introduced by the scheduler, where the action that causes callbacks from the source sequence to be forwarded
   *  may not execute immediately, despite the zero due time.
   *
   *  Errors produced by the source sequence are always forwarded to the result sequence, even if the error occurs before the duration.
   * @param {Number} duration Duration for skipping elements from the start of the sequence.
   * @param {Scheduler} scheduler Scheduler to run the timer on. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.timeout.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence with the elements skipped during the specified duration from the start of the source sequence.
