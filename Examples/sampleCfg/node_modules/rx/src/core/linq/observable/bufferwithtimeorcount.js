     *  Projects each element of an observable sequence into a buffer that is completed when either it's full or a given amount of time has elapsed.
     *
     * @example
     *  1 - res = source.bufferWithTimeOrCount(5000, 50); // 5s or 50 items in an array
     *  2 - res = source.bufferWithTimeOrCount(5000, 50, scheduler); // 5s or 50 items in an array
     *
     * @param {Number} timeSpan Maximum time length of a buffer.
     * @param {Number} count Maximum element count of a buffer.
     * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler]  Scheduler to run bufferin timers on. If not specified, the timeout scheduler is used.
     * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence of buffers.
