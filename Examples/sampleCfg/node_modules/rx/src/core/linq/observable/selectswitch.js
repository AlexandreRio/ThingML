   *  Projects each element of an observable sequence into a new sequence of observable sequences by incorporating the element's index and then

   * @param {Any} [thisArg] Object to use as this when executing callback.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence whose elements are the result of invoking the transform function on each element of source producing an Observable of Observable sequences
   *  and that at any point in time produces the elements of the most recent inner observable sequence that has been received.
