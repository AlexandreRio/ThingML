  /**
   *  Returns elements within the specified duration from the end of the observable source sequence, using the specified schedulers to run timers and to drain the collected elements.
   * @description
   *  This operator accumulates a queue with a length enough to store elements received during the initial duration window.
   *  As more elements are received, elements older than the specified duration are taken from the queue and produced on the
   *  result sequence. This causes elements to be delayed with duration.
   * @param {Number} duration Duration for taking elements from the end of the sequence.
   * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler]  Scheduler to run the timer on. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.timeout.
   * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence with the elements taken during the specified duration from the end of the source sequence.
