This is an example to test if the loggergenerator works.

We have two sets of client-server that communicate with each other.

one is simple cilent-server exchanges only one message defined in messge_extra_test.

the other shows booking hotel process defined in API1, bookhotel_client,  bookhotel_server
which contains several messages exchanges.

we can add configurations in file configs to build thingml models for testing logging.

logger_ExtraConfig is the file generated by LoggerGenerator which trace the process of
the message exchanges between the two sets of client-server when running with SMAC support.
